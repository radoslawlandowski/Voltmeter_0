Things worth taking into consideration:
The main purpose of this project WAS NOT to make a precision measurement equipment 
but rather face the problems of a multidevice I2C communication, 
data synchronisation and creating a proper PCB layout. 
The voltmeter is used for tracking rough changes in voltage, 
analysing dependencies between them and as a learning platform. 
Also this project allowed me to gather most of the knowledge about 
electronics and microcontroller programming that I've gained so far and sum it up.

Features:
# Atmega8, external ADC and IO port expander communicating   via I2C.
# 4 channel
# Three different ranges: 2x(0-5v); (0-7,5v); (0-10v);
# Overlimit signalization

Drawbacks:
# low resolution: 8-bit ADC
# no input filtering
# no input averaging function

Things to be done/improved:
# communication via USB with PC
